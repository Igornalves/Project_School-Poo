## School System Project

Welcome to the repository of the system made in Poo
here we have a project developed in:

<br>

<div align="center" style="display: inline_block">
<img alt="java" width="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg">
</div>

## A little about the repository

it was designed to look like a table in a database

in a way that would be aligned with the knowledge acquired in object-oriented programming

I will be leaving comments on some of these projects so that those of you who are interested can understand what is happening in the project and in the code. <br>

## Result of the finished project:

https://github.com/Igornalves/Project_School-Poo/assets/134658180/4574ed82-5a12-47df-8072-fe5ddfd5cd86
